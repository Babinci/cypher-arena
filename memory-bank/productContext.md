# Product Context: Cypher Arena

## Why This Project Exists
Freestyle rap battles are a dynamic cultural phenomenon, but existing tools for practice and organization are scattered and lack customization. Cypher Arena addresses this gap by providing a centralized platform for both fun and competitive freestyle activities. The goal is to be a tool for players, judges, organizers, and also a source of viral content 

## Problems It Solves
- **For artists and communities**: A structured environment for freestyle practice and battle organization.
- **For event organizers**: Tools to manage tournaments with battle modes, pre-eliminations, customized rounds, and judging systems.

## How It Should Work
- Users can access various modules (practice, battle, beat playback).
    - In future there will be paid features
    - There might be early access for test users to some implemented paid features
- Practice modes guide users with word prompts, topics, or images to improve their skills.
- Organizers can create tournaments with pre-eliminations, user management, and flexible judging criteria.
- Beat playback seamlessly integrates with the practice and battle modules.

## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive UI/UX emphasizing ease of use during freestyle sessions.
- Responsive design to ensure compatibility on both desktop, mobile and big stage screens
- Secure backend to protect proprietary data (word/image databases).

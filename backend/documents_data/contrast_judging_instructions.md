# Contrast Pairs Judging Instructions for Polish Freestyle Audience

## Rating Scale
Use the following scale when judging if a Polish freestyle audience would know a contrast pair:

1 - They will NOT know this pair (very niche, specialized, or from domains far outside their cultural awareness)
4 - Some of them will know this pair (mixed recognition, might be known to specific segments)
10 - They will CERTAINLY know this pair (universally recognized in this audience)

## Important Considerations

### Audience Profile
Based on research, the Polish freestyle audience typically:
- Is primarily young (16-30 years old) with a majority male demographic
- Has deep knowledge of Polish and global hip-hop culture
- Is digitally connected and active on social media platforms
- Has good awareness of contemporary Polish popular culture
- Possesses knowledge of major political and social references common in rap lyrics
- Is urban-centered but not exclusively from large cities
- Follows memes, internet culture, and viral content
- Has varying levels of education and socioeconomic backgrounds

### Domain Knowledge Assessment
- **High Recognition Areas**: Polish hip-hop artists, popular music, major Polish politicians, social media platforms, viral internet culture, major brands/services, mainstream sports figures, popular TV shows
- **Medium Recognition Areas**: Current events, mainstream international music/culture, popular films/games, major historical figures
- **Low Recognition Areas**: Niche gaming studios, specialized technical fields, international websites not popular in Poland, obscure historical or literary references, highly specialized professional domains

### Common Pitfalls
- Don't overestimate knowledge of international technical platforms, especially if they're not popular in Poland
- Don't assume familiarity with specialized professional domains unless they're frequently referenced in popular culture
- Gaming studios are less known than the games themselves
- International comparison websites (like IMDB) may have low recognition compared to Polish equivalents
- Be careful with slang terms and ensure they're in their correct grammatical form ("morda" vs. "mordo")
- Don't underestimate knowledge of traditional vs. modern profession contrasts, which may be more recognizable than they appear
- Avoid rating highly when one entity is a part of the other (like band members vs. their band)
- Be cautious with technical gaming terminology, which may be less familiar than general gaming references
- Don't overestimate recognition of older bands/artists that aren't mainstream in current pop culture
- Foreign culinary terms may be less recognizable than their Polish equivalents
- Linguistic contrasts (spelling variations) may be confusing rather than recognizable
- Consider that Polish footballers may be more recognizable to the audience than initially assumed
- Be cautious with VR technology examples as they may be less familiar when there are many variations

## Balancing Factors
- Recency: More recent cultural phenomena may be better known than older references
- Media presence: Entities with strong Polish media presence will be more recognized
- Geographic relevance: Polish entities are generally better known than international ones
- Hip-hop mentions: Entities frequently referenced in Polish rap will have higher recognition
- Social media presence: Entities popular on platforms used by the audience will be better known

Use these guidelines to make consistent judgments about how recognizable each contrast pair would be to a Polish freestyle audience.

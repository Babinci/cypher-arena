i want changes to timer:

from frontend/src/components/BattleMode/SharedControls/TimerControls.js
  - "Zmniejsz Interwał" = "decreaseInterval" (line 65)
  - "Zwiększ Interwał" = "increaseInterval" (line 66)
  - "Interwał" = "interval" (line 59)

  so currently decreaseInterval and  increaseInterval are at the lower part of timer- i want to move them to be right from  interval - and with + and -

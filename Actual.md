i am thinking of font sizes in frontend frontend/src/components/BattleMode/WordModes  ;

the problem is i need one consistent font across all modes that will be nicely displayed within rectangle;
the challenge is they can vary
- in frontend/src/components/BattleMode/WordModes/WordMode.js  i can have small 3 character word,
- in  frontend/src/components/BattleMode/WordModes/TopicMode.js i can have 5 words topics, 
- in frontend/src/components/BattleMode/WordModes/ContrastingMode.js i can have 4 words vs 4 words pairs
and some words can be longer

# ImagesMode Timer Positioning Task

## Objective
Implement proper layout for the ImagesMode component, with a specific focus on ensuring the lower border of the image is tangent to the upper border of the timer in non-full screen mode.

## Current Issue
In the ImprovedImagesMode component, the image overlaps with the timer control panel. This is because the StyledTimerControls component from the feature branch uses fixed positioning, while the original ImagesMode component uses flex layout.

## What Was Tried

### Approach 1: Padding and Margin Adjustments
- Added padding to the ImageContainer component to create space for the timer
- Adjusted margins to attempt to create the desired tangent effect
- Issue: Fixed positioning of the timer in StyledTimerControls breaks the layout flow

### Approach 2: Container Positioning
- Changed the layout of the parent container to handle fixed positioning
- Added position:relative to create a positioning context
- Issue: Still resulted in overlap between image and timer

### Approach 3: Absolute Positioning
- Set the TimerSection to position:absolute at the bottom
- Made ImageContainer height fixed to exclude timer space
- Added margin to create separation
- Issue: Didn't resolve the overlap

### Approach 4: Component Swap
- Tried replacing StyledTimerControls with the original TimerControls component
- Attempted to match the layout from the main branch
- Issue: While closer to the original, still didn't achieve the desired layout

## Key Findings
1. The fixed positioning in StyledTimerControls takes the timer out of the normal document flow, making it difficult to create the desired tangent effect.
2. The negative margins used in the original implementation (-10px on both containers) work when the components are in the normal document flow, but not with fixed positioning.
3. The timer height seems to be around 180px, which needs to be accounted for in any layout solution.

## Potential Solutions
1. Create a completely custom implementation that doesn't use StyledTimerControls
2. Modify StyledTimerControls to use relative positioning instead of fixed
3. Use a different approach to positioning that doesn't rely on negative margins

The most important requirement is that the lower border of the image must be tangent to the upper border of the timer in non-full screen mode, while maintaining all existing styling.

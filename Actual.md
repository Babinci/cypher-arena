i have feedback from ux designer- he is artistic soul:

read ux_designer_feedback.md

we need to make change in frontend based on feedback- think HARD on how to achieve it

look in memory-bank for system patterns and then in frontend code

Crucial important:
- all modes must work as they were (words must be displayed, as well as images)
- all timer logic must work the same


I propose you  to:
- analyze deeply system paterns and frontend code
- make plan of changes to implement fully ux designer feedback

when making changes:
- keep in mind that timer should be very clearly visible and functional, yet to have maximal 15 percent of the screen height
- keep in mind that current words proportions in  frontend/src/components/BattleMode/WordModes are perfect- dont change them

we can make these parts of timer: 
<timer_parts>
Stoper: 6 seconds
Interwa≈Ç: 35 seconds
Czas Rundy: Infinity
</timer_parts>
in one line- that would save some screen height


generally, i need also first site, landing page to be completely astonishing- for now it is the most amateur looking

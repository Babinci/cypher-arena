i have feedback from ux designer- he is artistic soul:

read ux_designer_feedback.md

we need to make change in frontend based on feedback- think HARD on how to achieve it

look in memory-bank for system patterns and then in frontend code

Crucial important:
- all modes must work as they well (words must be displayed, as well as images)
- all timer logic must work the same

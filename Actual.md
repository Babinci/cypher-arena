i have problem that i cant see words in word mode, topic mode and contrastive mode; they are very small and it looks like 
images in images mode and words in that mode are overshadowed by background/ rest of gui; there may be some bug. figure out very 
carefully what is happening
you must check globally for this problem 
frontend/src/components/BattleMode/ImagesMode
and
frontend/src/components/BattleMode/WordModes

because it seems that something is overshadowing displayed items

also i cant see currently back button in battle modes (image, topic word and contrastive modes)
